/**
 * I18n framework for JSesh.
 * The goal of the current module is to centralize all 
 * the material in JSesh which might be internationalized
 * (save the generic texts in JHotdraw).
 * 
 * As of now, it's not simple to do that. In particular, 
 * the JSesh widgets (JMDCEditor for instance) use an 
 * old framework we had designed a long time ago.
 * 
 * We might need some work to adapt to this centralized system.
